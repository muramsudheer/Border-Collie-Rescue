        <p class="info">Screwball is a playful 8 month old puppy who would make a wonderful companion for an active dog family. The current owners had never owned a dog before and miscalculated the amount of time and exercise Border Collies require. Screwball has gotten into repeated trouble for hiding in the bushes at the local golf course and stealing balls as they roll onto the 4th hole green. His owners tell us he has over 50 balls stashed away under their front porch.</p>
